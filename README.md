This is an ios app when I learned programmatically swift coding from the [course](https://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/course_video?id=1282)
The demo.pdf has the screenshots.

Here is another ios app [TruMove](http://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~jayar/ece1778/projects-videos-reports.html), my course project with other teammates.
Please scroll down all the way down to the bottom, there is our presentation and source code.
